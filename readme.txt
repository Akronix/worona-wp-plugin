== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Is Worona free? =
Yes, Worona is free and open source, and it will always be.

= Do I have to pay a monthly fee? =
No, there are no monthly fees. Worona is free unlike other WordPress plugins providing a similar service.

= How does Worona work? =
Worona consists of three fundamental parts:

*Dashboard*: an online dashboard to create, manage and customize your mobile apps and the rest of mobile channels. We’ve put everything in one place so you don’t need to install any extra tool in your computer. Our dashboard is intuitive and easy to use.

*Worona plugin*: an essential requirement to make Worona work. Its primary function is to synchronize our dashboard with your WordPress site.

*Mobile solutions or channels*: right now you can easily create native mobile apps for free. But our plan is to integrate HTML5 web apps, Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles too.

= Do I need technical or coding skills to use Worona? =
Of course not! Our dashboard will let you configure your mobile app and other solutions in just a few clicks, no need of programming or technical skills.

= Does Worona support my WordPress? =
Worona only supports blog posts for the moment, but it plans to be compatible with WooCommerce, custom post types and pages in the near future - we know these features are really important for you.

= Do I need to activate all the mobile channels? =
No, you don’t. You can choose which mobile channels you want to activate. These include mobile apps, a HTML5 web app, Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles. You can choose only the solution you need, or activate them all if you prefer. It’s up to you.

All our solutions are free, and Worona will not charge you if you choose more than one.

= Why do I need Worona instead of a responsive theme?  =
You don’t have to choose between Worona or a responsive theme. Creating a website with a responsive design has become essential, but is no longer enough.

In Google’s report, “The Need for Mobile Speed”, they found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. Waiting for pages to load is what users dislike the most when browsing the mobile web.

Worona significantly improves your mobile site’s performance. It helps you create a fast and a smooth mobile experience in a very easy way, which means bigger audiences and more chances for engagement.

= What’s the difference between mobile apps and HTML5 web apps?  =
Mobile apps have features that make them more convenient than websites: offline content, instant loading or push notifications are just a few of them. But HTML5 is bringing most of these features to mobile sites and making it possible to provide the same app-like experience in web apps. 

Some people won’t download an app because they don’t like it or already have too many, but others will find it more handy than accessing an URL.

Each solution has its own benefits, and no option is better or worse than another as it will always depend on your user’s needs. You can use both solutions and see what works better, or choose the one you already know is right for your customers.

= Will you publish my app to the stores? =
App submission is not included in our free product, but we offer a premium service to submit it to the stores if you don’t want to handle all the process yourself.

If you don’t want to pay, you can always do it yourself following our documentation.

= Can I publish an app without paying the developer accounts to Apple and Google? =
For the moment, the only way to publish an app to the Apple App Store and Google Play is by having your own developer accounts. This is why even though Worona is free, you still have to spend some money in order to have your app published.

If you don’t want to deal with the process of compiling your app, or don’t have an Apple and a Google developer account, we offer a service to publish your app to the stores.

= What happens if you release a new version of the app? =
Your app will be automatically updated, no need of publishing a new version to the stores.

= Will Worona work with my theme? =
Worona creates a native app and an HTML5 web app that are independent from your site appearance. We use the WordPress REST API to take the content from your WordPress and we display it in a client-side rendered app.

We are not wrapping your site inside a webview, this won’t make it perform better on mobile devices. This is why we can’t take your server-side-rendered theme and display it automatically inside the app. In any case, we encourage you to develop your own themes or ask your theme designer to port your WordPress theme to Worona.
