== Frequently Asked Questions ==
You’ll find an extended FAQs page on: [https://faq.worona.org](https://faq.worona.org/).

= Is Worona free? =
Yes, Worona is free and open source, and it will always be.

= Do I have to pay a monthly fee? =
No, there are no monthly fees. Worona is free unlike other WordPress plugins providing a similar service.

= How does Worona work? =
Worona consists of three fundamental parts:

*Dashboard*: an online dashboard to create, manage and customize your mobile apps and the rest of mobile channels. We’ve put everything in one place so you don’t need to install any extra tool in your computer. Our dashboard is very intuitive and easy to use.

*Worona plugin*: an essential requirement to make Worona work. Its primary function is to synchronize our dashboard with your WordPress site.

*Mobile solutions or channels*: right now you can easily create native mobile apps for free. But our plan is to integrate HTML5 web apps, Google AMP and Facebook Instant Articles too.

= Why do I need Worona instead of a responsive theme?  =
You don’t have to choose between Worona or a responsive theme. Creating a website with a responsive design has become essential these days, but is no longer enough.

In Google’s report, “The Need for Mobile Speed”, they found that 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages take longer than 3 seconds to load. Waiting for pages to load is what users dislike the most when browsing the mobile web.

Worona significantly improves your mobile site’s performance. It helps you create a fast and a smooth mobile experience in a very easy way, which means bigger audiences and more chances for engagement.

= Will you publish my app to the stores? =
App submission is not included in our free product, but we offer a premium service to publish your app to the stores if you don’t want to handle all the process yourself.

If you don’t want to pay, you can always do it yourself following our documentation.
